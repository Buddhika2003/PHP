**I am going to use this for learn PHP**

•I am starting php at the begining level.


•First I created a simple form for add username and email.
•And created action for that form.
•When someone submit a name and email, then it opens a new website was opened and give a echo message.
•I have learn GET and POST methods.


•Now I have created a form for submitted form data to the page itself, instead of jumping to a different page
